# ESP32 Template Project

This is just a simple project template for the ESP32 IDF development environment that I can reference back to for setting up future projects.

Check out the [setup.txt](https://github.com/jmatth11/esp32-template/blob/main/setup.txt) file to setup the environment and how to use the `idf.py` tool.
